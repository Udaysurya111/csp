        <h1>WORLD HEALTH DAY</h1>

        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p><span>7th of April is celebrated as the World Health Day which also marks the anniversary of World Health Organisation (WHO): </span></p>
	<p style="padding-bottom:20px;">a department of United Nations. Every year WHO focuses on a specific public health concern during which various health care organizations – both national and international come forward and strive towards various health concerns that grip the globe.</p>
	<h2>Key messages of Word Health Organization in 2025</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Health For All envisions a society in which all people have good health and may live happy lives in a peaceful, wealthy, and sustainable environment.</li>
		<li>The right to health is a fundamental human right. Everyone must have access to health care when and when they need it, without financial burden.</li>
		<li>Thirty percent of the world's population lacks access to basic health treatments.</li>
		<li>Almost two hundred crore people are facing catastrophic or impoverishing health-care costs, with considerable disparities impacting those in the most disadvantaged circumstances.</li>
		<li>Universal health coverage (UHC) provides financial security and access to high-quality necessary services, lifts people out of poverty, promotes family and community well-being, safeguards against public health emergencies.</li>
		<li>To make health for all a reality, we need: individuals and communities with access to high-quality health services, so they can care for their own and their families' health; skilled health workers who provide quality, people-centric care; and policymakers who are committed to investing in universal health coverage.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>World Health Day 2025: Significance</h2>
	<p>World Health Day is observed to educate people, spread awareness about health issues, new medicines, research and ensure healthcare facilities are accessible to everyone, everywhere. This day reminds people to take notice of their health and make improvements to lead a quality life. World Health Day marks an occasion for the organisation to discuss global health each year. This day is an opportunity for WHO to draw everyone’s attention toward their well-being.</p>

        <h2>WORLD HYGIENE DAY</h2>
        <p><span>World Hand Hygiene Day is marked every year on 5 May, to raise awareness of the importance of handwashing to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
	<p style="padding-bottom:20px;>ECDC supports this campaign and highlights the importance of infection prevention and control measures, especially hand hygiene, as key strategies to tackle the growing threat posed by antibiotic resistance.</P>
	<p>Each year on 5 May, the “Save lives: Clean Your Hands” campaign takes place as part of a major global effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO) to mobilise people around the world to increase adherence to hand hygiene in all healthcare settings. This protects healthcare workers and patients from healthcare-associated infections caused by various pathogens.</p>
	<p>Healthcare-associated infections, including those resistant to antibiotics, are a growing public health problem in Europe. However, a large percentage of these infections are preventable by improving hand hygiene practices.</p>
