        <h1>Types of Health</h1>

        <h2>DEFINITION:</h2>
        <p>Mental and physical health are probably the two most frequently discussed types of health. Spiritual, emotional, and financial health also contribute to overall health. Medical experts have linked these to lower stress levels and improved mental and physical well-being.
People with better financial health, for example, may worry less about finances and have the means to buy fresh food more regularly. Those with good spiritual health may feel a sense of calm and purpose that fuels good mental health. </p>

        <h2>Physical Health:</h2>
        
	<ul>
            <li>Promotes awareness about eco-friendly farming methods.</li>
            <li>Teaches students responsibility, teamwork, and practical skills.</li>
            <li>Encourages healthy eating habits and connection with nature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mental health:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides chemical-free, nutritious food for school meals.</li>
            <li>Reduces environmental pollution and conserves soil health.</li>
            <li>Enhances students’ knowledge about biodiversity and agriculture.</li>
